# Employee Attrition Prediction and Insights Dashboard

## Overview

The **Employee Attrition Prediction and Insights Dashboard** is a Streamlit application designed to help businesses predict employee attrition and gain actionable insights from employee data. By analyzing key employee attributes, the application identifies employees who are at risk of leaving the company, enabling HR teams and managers to take proactive measures to improve retention, reduce turnover costs, and enhance overall organizational performance.

## Features

- **Attrition Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of employees leaving the company using machine learning models (AdaBoost and Random Forest).
- **Risk Assessment**: Assigns risk percentages and categories (Low, Medium, High) to employees based on prediction probabilities.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Current vs. Predicted Attrition Rates.
  - Average Risk Percentage by Job Role, Department, and Tenure.
  - Individual Employee Dashboards showcasing key metrics.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provides data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to improve employee retention.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can upload employee data, select prediction models, adjust thresholds, and explore results interactively.
- **Downloadable Results**: Allows users to download the prediction results as a CSV file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **pip** package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rushita-Mehta/employee-attrition-dashboard.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
     Open your command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the project directory.
      ```bash
      cd path\to\employee-attrition-dashboard

Replace path\to\employee-attrition-dashboard with the actual path where you cloned or extracted the project.
3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Download Pre-trained Models**
   Place the pre-trained model files (ada_model.pkl and rf_model.pkl) into the models/ directory of the project.
5. **Run the Application**
   Start the Streamlit application using the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
6. **Access the Dashboard**
   After running the command, you will see output in the terminal similar to:
   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

   Local URL: http://localhost:8501
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the dashboard.

### Usage
Once the application is running and you have accessed the dashboard in your browser:

1. Upload Employee Data:
Click on the "Upload Employee Data" section.
Upload a CSV file containing employee data or paste CSV-formatted data into the provided text area.
2. Select Prediction Model and Threshold:
Choose between AdaBoost and Random Forest models.
Adjust the prediction threshold slider to suit your business needs.
3. View Results and Insights:
Explore the attrition predictions, risk assessments, and visualizations generated by the application.
Review insights and recommendations provided to improve employee retention.
4. Download Results:
Click on the "Download Results as CSV" button to save the predictions and insights to your computer.

### Data Requirements
For accurate predictions, your employee dataset should include the following columns:

EmployeeID: Unique identifier for each employee.
Age: Age of the employee.
Gender: Gender of the employee.
Department: Department where the employee works.
Tenure: Number of years the employee has been with the company.
JobRole: Role or position of the employee within the company.
Salary: Current salary of the employee.
JobSatisfaction: Self-reported job satisfaction score (out of 10).
EngagementScore: Employee engagement score (percentage).
PerformanceRating: Performance rating (out of 5).
WorkLifeBalance: Work-life balance rating (out of 5).
_Note: If any of these key columns are missing, the application will impute default values, but this may reduce prediction accuracy._
